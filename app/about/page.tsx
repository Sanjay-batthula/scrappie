            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Scrappie is an online platform that connects people who have scrap materials with buyers who can turn
              those materials into new products. We believe that waste is not something to be thrown away, but rather a
              valuable resource that can be used to create new things. By connecting buyers and sellers of scrap
              materials, we are helping to reduce waste, conserve resources, and create a more sustainable future.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Our mission is to make it easy and profitable for people to recycle their scrap materials. We want to
              create a world where waste is seen as a valuable resource, and where everyone has the opportunity to
              participate in the circular economy.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We envision a future where there is no such thing as waste. All materials are reused or recycled, and
              nothing is sent to landfill. We believe that Scrappie can play a role in making this vision a reality.

              We make it easy for sellers to get the best price for their scrap materials. We have a competitive bidding
              system that ensures that sellers get the highest possible price for their materials.
